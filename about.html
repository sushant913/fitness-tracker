                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    The Fitness Tracker web app was created to provide a simple, intuitive, and effective tool
                    for individuals to monitor their physical activity and progress. In an age where staying
                    fit is crucial, having a reliable way to track your workouts can be a significant motivator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to empower you by offering a personalized overview of your fitness journey,
                    helping you identify patterns, celebrate milestones, and stay consistent with your training goals.

                <h3>Why I Made It</h3>
                <p>
                    As a developer with a passion for fitness, I often found myself looking for a straightforward
                    way to log my workouts without the clutter of complex apps. This project is my answer to that need â€“
                    a clean, no-frills fitness tracker built with fundamental web technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It served as a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding of HTML for semantic structure,
                    CSS for responsive and appealing design, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions and data persistence.
                    Every line of code was written to achieve the project goals while adhering to best practices and
                    demonstrating core web development skills.

                <p>
                    Remember, your workout data is saved directly in your browser using `localStorage`. This means your data
                    will persist even if you close and reopen the browser, but it's specific to the browser and device you're using.
